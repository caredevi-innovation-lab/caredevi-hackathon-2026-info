## 🔴 Problem Statement

Patients recovering from injuries or surgeries are often prescribed physiotherapy exercises to perform at home. However, without direct clinical supervision:

- **Incorrect form** leads to slower recovery or re-injury
- **No real-time feedback** means patients don't know if they're doing exercises right
- **Low motivation** and lack of accountability reduce adherence to therapy plans
- **Doctor–patient communication gaps** make remote monitoring difficult
- **Limited access** to physiotherapy clinics, especially in rural or underserved areas

Traditional telehealth solutions offer video calls but cannot analyze body movement or provide automated, objective evaluations of exercise performance.

---

## ✅ Solution Description

**DevCare** is an AI-powered telerehabilitation platform that transforms any device with a camera into a smart physiotherapy assistant. It bridges the gap between clinical supervision and home-based recovery.

### How It Works

1. **Real-Time Pose Detection** — Using MediaPipe Pose, the system captures 33 body landmarks through the patient's webcam and calculates joint angles in real time. All processing happens **client-side** in the browser — no video is ever uploaded to a server.

2. **Intelligent Exercise Evaluation** — Custom rule-based evaluators analyze each exercise (Bicep Curl, Squat, Shoulder Raise, Knee Extension, Hip Abduction) with biomechanical thresholds. The system provides:
   - Rep counting with stage detection (up/down)
   - Dynamic accuracy scoring (0–100%)
   - Multi-layer corrections with severity levels (e.g., *"Keep elbow tucked closer"* — HIGH)
   - Voice coaching via Web Speech API with cooldown logic to avoid spamming

3. **Doctor–Patient Collaboration** — Doctors can:
   - Assign personalized rehabilitation plans with ordered exercises
   - Monitor patient session history, body-part scores, and progress trends
   - Provide clinical feedback with star ratings and guidance notes
   - Connect with patients via secure QR-code join links

4. **CareBot AI Assistant** — Powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, CareBot helps doctors generate targeted rehab plans by:
   - Querying the exercise template database
   - Adapting intensity based on age, severity, and pain level
   - Producing editable todo lists that sync directly to patient plans
   - All outputs require doctor review before assignment (human-in-the-loop)

5. **Progress Analytics** — Patients and doctors can track:
   - Accuracy trends over time (area charts)
   - Activity volume (bar charts with pagination)
   - GitHub-style consistency heatmaps (28-day view)
   - Anatomical recovery progress with body-part score visualization
   - Session streaks and completion rates

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/DevCare.git
cd DevCare/src
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Django)

```bash
cd devcare-server

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
# Create a .env file in devcare-server/ with:
echo GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here > .env

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# (Optional) Create a superuser for admin access
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Start the backend server
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

```bash
# Open a new terminal
cd devcare-client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### 4. Quick Start Guide

1. **Register** as a **Doctor** and a **Patient** (two separate accounts)
2. As the Doctor: go to **Connect** → generate a **QR / Join Link**
3. As the Patient: visit the join link to connect with the doctor
4. As the Doctor: go to **Assign Therapy** → create a rehabilitation plan with exercises
5. As the Patient: go to **My Sessions** → start a therapy session
6. Allow camera access and perform the exercises with real-time AI coaching
7. After completion, view your **Session Results** and **Progress** analytics
8. As the Doctor: review the patient's session in **Patient Detail** and submit feedback
